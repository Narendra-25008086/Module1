# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
4. Print the complex number x.
5. Print the real part of x using x.real.
6. Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.

## 💻 Program
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(complex(a,b))

## Result
Enter the real part: 2
Enter the imaginary part: 3
Complex Number: (2+3j)
Real Part: 2.0
Imaginary Part: 3.0
